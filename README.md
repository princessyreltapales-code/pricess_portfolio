# Reflection
    Building this portfolio was a great opportunity to apply what I’ve learned while also pushing beyond my comfort zone. One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing the overall structure and flow of the site. It’s one thing to design individual pages, but ensuring consistency across all sections—both in design and code—required careful planning. I solved this by creating a clear wireframe and component structure before starting development, which helped me stay organized and avoid duplication.

    Another challenge was optimizing performance and accessibility. I realized early on that some of my image assets and animations were affecting load time, especially on mobile. After researching performance optimization techniques, I compressed images, removed unnecessary libraries, and used lazy loading where appropriate. This significantly improved page speed and responsiveness.Version control and deployment were also areas of growth. While I had used GitHub before, managing commits, branches, and merges for a solo project taught me the value of clean commit history and regular backups. Deploying via [Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages] made it easy, but I had to troubleshoot a few environment-specific bugs, which improved my debugging skills.

    Looking ahead, I’d like to enhance the portfolio by adding a dark mode toggle, integrating a CMS for easy project updates, and including more detailed case studies for each project. I’d also explore using TypeScript for stronger code reliability. This project gave me a deeper understanding of full-stack workflows and taught me how to approach design and development more holistically.
